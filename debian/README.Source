All minified files (*.min.js) were removed from the upstream tarball,
because these files are generated from source now.

Also, the plugin jquery.flot.navigate.js was removed, because it
contains obfuscated code. I will include it when the libs
jquery.mousewheel and jquery.event.drag turn into a package.
